\chapter{Introduction}
The Trusted Platform Module is a device designed to enhance the security of computing platforms. Many different vendors produce these devices while adhering to the standardized specifications, which define both the mandatory and the optional components. This results in devices having the required functionality in common, but the optional functionality is left to the device architects to include. Thus the produced devices may vary in functionality and performance because the implementation details vary across different vendors.

The objective of this thesis is to implement a tool for the visualization of data collected from Trusted Platform Modules. The resulting tool should be able to create visualizations for several datasets which report on supported functionality, performance characteristics, and cryptographic properties. The visualizations should also be compatible with datasets that report on similar information collected from different secure devices, the JavaCard smart cards.

The first chapter provides an overview of Trusted Platform Module technology. The second chapter analyses the current state of an existing solution for visualization and describes design decisions behind the tool created as the objective of this thesis. The final chapter  presents the outcome of this thesis, a tool called \texttt{AlgTest pyProcess}.
